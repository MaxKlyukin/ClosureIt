# ClosureIt

## Please do not use it in production!

ClosureIt is a PHP library that can generate SQL statement from PHP closures.
This library is not for production purposes.
It has many limitations.
The reason it exists because I wanted to learn how to write a Lexer, and because IDEs usually can do autocomplete for PHP code.

Examples you can find in test directory.
